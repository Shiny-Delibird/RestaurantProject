This is a project built to organize and manage a Restaurant

It was built over the span of about 2 months in a team of 4 using Java to build the backend system of the restaurant, and JavaFX to run the GUI and desktop application.

I was the backend manager in charge of storing and maintaining inventory data along with processing orders received from the desktop application.

The focus of the project was extensible, modular, design and we adhered to SOLID design principles and established design patterns to build robust, resuable code.
